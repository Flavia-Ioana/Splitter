# Splitter
 
Project description: This project implies an application that can receive big files and split them into several smaller files. This project is useful for sending a big file over a channel that only allows a small chunk of data to be sent at a time. The application must also be able to put the original file together given all the small files.

Technologies: Rust Programming Language, Command-Line Argument Parsing, File Handling, SHA-256 Hashing ensuring data integrity during file splitting and reassembling, Error Handling for robustness.
